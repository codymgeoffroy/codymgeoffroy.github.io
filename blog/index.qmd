This blog documents my learning journey as I build skills in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science. Here you'll find problem solutions, analysis walkthroughs, tutorials, and reflections on concepts I'm learning.

## Topics Covered

- Bioinformatics algorithms and Rosalind solutions
- Data analysis and visualization techniques
- Programming tips and tricks (Python, R, Bash, SQL)
- Tools and workflow optimization
- Learning resources and reflections
