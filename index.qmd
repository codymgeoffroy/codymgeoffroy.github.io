# Bioinformatics & Computational Biology

I'm building a foundation in bioinformatics through hands-on problem solving and data analysis. With a background in biomedical sciences and genomics, I'm passionate about using computational approaches to understand biological systems.

**Currently:** Developing skills in Python, R, and bioinformatics algorithms | Solving Rosalind problems | Building analysis pipelines
