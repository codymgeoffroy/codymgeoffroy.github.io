# Building Computational Skills for Biological Discovery

I'm a biomedical sciences graduate with a focus on genomics and bioinformatics, developing expertise in Python, R, and computational problem-solving. My goal is to apply data science and algorithmic thinking to understand complex biological systems.

**Currently:** Solving bioinformatics challenges on Rosalind | Building analysis pipelines | Learning full-stack development
