The samples were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The tissues were then prepared as flat-mounts and scanned using automated color fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The samples that were scanned for CGRP-IR axons – at 488 nm – were digitized and traced using a 3D neuron reconstruction software and finally quantified using ImageJ2 (Fiji). Within CGRP-IR axons, 2D and 3D digitalized axonal tracings have not been reported in the whole mouse heart, as a result, this data expanded that very limited dataset.\n\nDownload Poster (PDF)\nMethods & Tools\nFluorescence/Confocal Microscopy · Neurolucida · ImageJ · GraphPad Prism · Microsoft Word/Excel · Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator · BioRendeer\n\n\n\nMutant U1A-RNA Binding Kinetics with Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\nRole: Undergraduate Researcher\nAdvisor: Dr. Robert Borgon · Department of Biomedical Sciences · University of Central Florida\nDuration: August 2022 – May 2023\nPresentation: Amy Zeh High Impact Practice Student Showcase · University of Central Florida · April 19, 2023\n\n\nThis study involved the use of U1A which is a protein subunit that is part of the U1 snRNP and binds to U1 hairpin II (U1hpII) of the snRNA that associates with the U1 snRNP. The U1A wildtype is compared to point mutations incorporated into the mutated protein to find amino acids residues that have significance in binding. The binding efficacy is measured through kinetic data produced via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) which flows U1hpII over a NTA chip that has a ligand (i.e., U1A wildtype or mutants) immobilized to it via a His-tag. The produced binding curves will show the association and disassociation phases in which a mathematical model was applied to obtain the relevant kinetic constants (i.e., ka, kd, kDa). Furthermore, a proteomic analysis was done comparing the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of both U1A mutants and another critical subunit in the U1 snRNP.\n\nDownload Poster (PDF)\nMethods & Tools\nSurface Plasmon Resonance · PCR · Bacterial Cell Culture · R (programming language) · TraceDrawer · Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint · GIMP · GraphPad Prism · BioRender\n\n\nMicrobiome gDNA analysis of non-infected and infected zombie ants using Illumina sequencing\n\nRole: Undergraduate Student in Research-intensive Course\nProfessor: Dr. Anna Forsman · Genomics & Bioinformatics Cluster · University of Central Florida\nDuration: January 2022 – May 2023\n\n\nThis study consisted of extracting and analyzing gDNA from the inside of ant gut microbiomes. The ants of interest are known as “Zombie Ants” because of a unique disease they contract from a pathogenic fungus called Ophiocordyceps that causes them to change their behavior and commit suicide so to promote more growth of the fungi. The objective was to find if there are any differences between the gut microbiome of ants infected with Ophiocordyceps (a fungus that manipulates then kills), Beauveria (a fungus that simply kills) or a normal ant that was treated with a placebo. The gDNA was extracted from the ants using a Microprep Kit then ran through a two-step PCR protocol to amplify the extracted gDNA. Next, a SpeedBead cleanup protocol was run to separate the loose primers/small fragments from the amplified gDNA to increase sequencing data quality. Finally, sequencing was performed using an in-house Illumina platform and the data was analyzed using QIIME 2 to cross-reference with BLAST in order to determine the genetic diversity present.\n\nMethods & Tools\nIllumina Sequencing · PCR · QIIME · Agarose Gel Electrophoresis · Microsoft Word/Excel"
