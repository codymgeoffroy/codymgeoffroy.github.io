## Education

**Biotechnology, M.S. (incomplete)**  
University of Central Florida | 2024-2025

**Biomedical Sciences, B.S.**  
*Minor in Genomics & Bioinformatics | Minor in Anthropology*  
University of Central Florida | 2019-2023


## My Journey

My interest in bioinformatics emerged from a fascination with how computational approaches can decode biological complexity. With a foundation in biomedical sciences and genomics, I'm now focused on building strong programming and data analysis skills to bridge wet-lab biology and computational research.

I'm working through bioinformatics problem sets, building analysis pipelines, and documenting my learning journey through this portfolio. My background includes teaching experience in gymnastics and education, which has strengthened my ability to break down complex concepts and communicate effectively.

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages**
- Python (primary focus for bioinformatics)
- R (statistical analysis and visualization)
- Bash/Shell scripting
- SQL for database querying

**Bioinformatics Tools & Platforms**
- Git/GitHub for version control
- Linux/WSL development environment
- Quarto for reproducible research
- Data analysis libraries (pandas, NumPy, BioPython)

**Computational Biology**
- Sequence analysis algorithms
- Statistical methods for genomics
- Data visualization
- Pipeline development

## Interests Beyond Science

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
#### Scuba Diving
Open-water and nitrox certified. Diving demands methodical preparation, situational awareness, and staying calm under pressure — skills that translate directly to research and problem solving.

#### Martial Arts
Black belt in Taekwondo, with training in Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Martial arts taught me that mastery is a process, not a destination — a philosophy I carry into learning bioinformatics.
