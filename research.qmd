Undergraduate and graduate research grounded in genomics and computational
biology. My work focuses on applying quantitative methods to biological
questions — connecting wet-lab context with data-driven analysis.

## Undergraduate Research

### Mutant U1A-RNA binding kinetics with surface plasmon resonance {#undergrad}

- **Role:** Undergraduate Researcher
- **Advisor:** Dr. Robert Borgon · Department of Biomedical Sciences · University of Central Florida
- **Duration:** [Year] – [Year]

[2–3 sentences: what the project was, why it mattered, what biological
question it addressed. Write this as a narrative, not a list.]

**Contributions**

- [Specific, active-voice contribution — what *you* did, not what the lab did]
- [e.g., "Designed and executed PCR protocols for X samples across Y conditions"]
- [e.g., "Analyzed sequence alignment output using custom Python scripts"]

**Methods & Tools**

- [Technique or tool] · [Technique or tool] · [Technique or tool]

**Outcome**

[1–2 sentences on what was produced or found — a result, a dataset,
a presentation, a report. Be specific.]

**Course:** [Course Name] · [Semester Year]
**Institution:** [University Name]

[2–3 sentences describing the project, the problem it addressed, and the
approach taken. Lead with what the project *did*, not what you were assigned.]

**Key outcomes:** [1 sentence — what you produced or demonstrated.]

## Research Interests {#interests}

My primary interests are in computational genomics — particularly sequence
analysis, variant interpretation, and building reproducible pipelines for
high-throughput biological data. I'm drawn to work that sits at the
intersection of algorithmic problem-solving and biological discovery,
and I'm actively developing the computational foundation to contribute
to that kind of research.
