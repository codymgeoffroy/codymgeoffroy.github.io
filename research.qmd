## Research Interests

My research interests focus on:

- **Genomics:** Understanding genetic variation and its functional implications
- **Computational Biology:** Developing algorithms for biological data analysis
- **Bioinformatics:** Building pipelines for high-throughput data processing
- **Systems Biology:** Integrating multi-omics data to understand biological systems

I'm interested in opportunities to apply computational methods to genomic research and contribute to data-driven biological discovery.
