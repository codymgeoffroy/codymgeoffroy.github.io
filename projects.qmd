A working collection of bioinformatics problem sets, genomic data analysis,
and development projects — built while working toward computational biology
research and data science applications.

All projects are version-controlled and documented on
[GitHub](https://github.com/codymgeoffroy).

## Rosalind Problem Sets {#rosalind}

Algorithm implementations in Python and R for problems from
[Rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info) — covering string algorithms,
sequence analysis, graph theory, and molecular biology fundamentals.

## Data Analysis {#analysis}

Applied bioinformatics workflows using R and Python — including genomic
data processing, statistical analysis, and reproducible visualization.

::: {#analysis-projects}
